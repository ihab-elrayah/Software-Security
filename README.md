# Software-Security

Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, requested assistance in improving the security of their web application by implementing a file verification step for secure communications. This enhancement aimed to safeguard sensitive financial data and provide a secure platform for their clients' financial planning needs.

In the software security assessment for Artemis Financial, I excelled in identifying vulnerabilities and minimizing false positives. Coding securely is crucial to protect both the company and its users from potential harm and loss of sensitive information. Software security adds value to a company's overall well-being by safeguarding data, building trust, minimizing risks, and ensuring uninterrupted operations.

The vulnerability assessment process presented challenges in accurately identifying areas of vulnerability and prioritizing them. However, the dependency check tool proved to be a valuable asset in detecting vulnerabilities efficiently.

I increased security layers by updating libraries and fortifying vulnerable layers. In the future, I would use penetration testing and online databases to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques.

I make sure the code and software application's functionality and security through rigorous testing, including debugs and vulnerability assessments. After refactoring the code, I conducted additional testing to identify any potential new vulnerabilities.

Stack overflow has been my number one tool when I get stuck, many solved example problem with descriptions.

I can demonstrate my skills and experience in secure communication by showcasing my implementation of a hash function for encrypted communications. This highlights my experecnce in encryption and data protection.
